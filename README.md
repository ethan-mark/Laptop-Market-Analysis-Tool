# microcenter_webscraping_analysis
This is a web scraping project using Selenium Python to extract the laptop search query data from Microcenter to help answer the question of "Which laptop should you buy?".  

This data is then processed through Pandas and exported to a CSV for data cleaning. 

The data is cleaned using Excel/Sheets for duplicates, incorrect data, and NULLs.


The data is visualized using Tableau showcasing which laptop has the highest discount % along with the rating per laptop.
